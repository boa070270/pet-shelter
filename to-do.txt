- IFilter:
  bring all parameters to this type
  make filter-dialog-component
  show this dialog on showDialogFilter instead simple one input

- Task! Swagger! What do I need to do with forms that need dynamically change its content?

- Task! Table! I want extend status bar to show number of all rows and number of filtered rows

- Task! Exclude material
  - Task! Change AuthDialog (it uses material)
  - Task! Change AppPage

- Task! table-component needs to be readable only
- Task! Swagger form do not validate number, allow input string
- Task! What do with table that reference to another table?
- Task? SwaggerObject, maybe move required to constriction?



DONE! Task! Is there enough one form of field in the swagger? Let's look at the field that represent <img>,
to the edit mode we need input to fill the src, but when we in the view mode maybe we need this picture..
What is SwaggerObject, what a role it completes?
  - it describes data that we need collect through SwaggerForm
  - it describes how we present some data?
  e.g. Dynamic page:
  <our-tag-1 swagger="swagger-id"/> we need swagger here because we need fill the form that describes what data will be displayed.
  So through SwaggerObject and SwaggerForm we allow user to dynamically fill the page.
  But what is the table? Table also is a presentation component, it also needs swagger to describe what and how it would present.

  Decision: The Form can be dynamical. To describe its behavior I provide these rules:
  behavior: {
    [field: string]: Rule[] //field can be this form or children form, for children use format field.field
  }
  Rule: {c: Condition, hide?:[fields,], show?:[fields,], disable?:[fields,], enable?:[fields,]}
  Condition: [,]<value | >value | !value | =value
    you can use coma to define sequence of value, e.g. ,=one,two,three - this condition is true when value of field is one, or two, or three

DONE! - Task! Swagger! Need to provide property "immutable", that do not allow edit field if it has parameter.
DONE!  - Form does not show errors!
DONE! - BUG! on test table occurs error field position not found?
DONE! - BUG! Swagger! there isn't applied "disable". The view dialog on test table allow editing
DONE! - Task! DataSource need to know how update/add/delete rows
DONE! Table! need to ask on delete
DONE! BUG! The dialog do not work!
DONE! Task! needs text formatting function
DONE!- Task! table-component needs to take custom form to edit/view/add
DONE!- Task! need to takeout all configurations texts to a new service, than this service will take this texts from backend
  - TableComponent
DONE! - BUG! There are errors in MainDataSource:
  DONE! - workers don't deleted! If there are error!
  DONE! - on banner is incorrect behavior, we see the same data when change paging. Paging become 10, there are not so many banners.
